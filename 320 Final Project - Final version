    "<b>I. INTRODUCTION & MOTIVATION:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to outline the steps of the data science pipeline. To demonstrate this, I will be analyzing google search trends for outfit-related google searches over the past year, 5 years, and 10 years. I chose to analyze google searches with the phrase \"outfits with\" to provide the largest set of data related to by desired research. I tried a variety of different search phrases including \"how to style\", \"styling\", \"how to wear\", etc... and found that the \"outfits with\" search phrase provided that most relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this data collection is to identify clothing items that will maintain relevance in the long-run, and what groups of individuals are most profitable to market to. Why is this analysis helpful? Let's say you would like to become a small business owner of an online boutique. In order to ensure the clothes you carry do not fall out of trend before they are able to be sold, focus should be placed on clothing items that will maintain relevance and popularity for years to come. Maybe you are more focused on the sustainability of items you carry (using recycled polyesters, stainless steel, etc..). It would then also be in your best interest to advertise clothing that you could advertise as timeless, staple pieces in a wardrobe such as jeans and a white cotton tee shirt. This data would also be useful in targeted ads. \n",

    "In this stage of the data life cycle, I am taking a closer look at the data to observe more trends.\n",
    "A few important things to note from these trends can be concluded without any further data processing:\n",
    "   - 1. There are many search terms that specifically relate to women and girls and items traditionally marketed toward this respective demographic (\"outfits for girls\", \"skirts\", \"heels\", \"leggings\", \"dresses\", \"outfits for women\") but few for men and boys (\"outfits for men\" at 9% and 5% in the 5 year and 1 year trend datasets, respectively, as well as \"mens outfits\" at 25% in the past year). Also note that there are searches for girl's outfits but none for boy's outfits. We do see an increase in overall searches relating to men's outfits in the past year compared to the last 5 and 10 years, respectively. This could be an indication for a potentially larger market for variety in men's clothing in the future. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - 2. As mentioned previously, searches for \"cute outfits\" and \"black outfits\" were very common. Jeans were also a high search term for all time periods.\n",
    "   - 3. A search term with lower volume, but still relatively high, were searches for boots.\n",
    "   - 4. For every time period, searches for jeans and shorts outperformed searches for skirts and dresses.\n",
    "   - 5. The search term for \"tumblr outfits\" had popularity in the past 10 years, but not the past 1 year or 5 years. This is an indicator that this is no longer marketable. Let's now take a look at google search trends for \"tumblr\" to determine if this can provide insight as to why this may be the case.\n",

    "How is this data useful? Let's look at two primary uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "LONGEVITY OF PRODUCTS\n",
    "\n",
    "This data indicates the search terms \"cute outfits\", \"jeans\", and \"boots\" have remained popular over the past 10 years. Additonally, something to note is the term \"black outfits\" appears once in this graph, but does make the top 5 search terms across multiple time frames. How is the data useful? As mentioned previously, if looking to start a boutique or fashion-focused small business, it would likely be wise to sell items that are in high demand. While \"cute outfits\" is an ambiguous term, \"boots\" and \"jeans\" are not. If we wanted to do more in-depth research with this, we could take a look at which fit of jeans and type of boots retain the most relevancy across a ten year time frame (skinny jeans vs. loose fit jeans, ankle boots vs. riding boots, etc...). \n",
    "\n",
    "SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO)\n",
    "\n",
    "This data could be useful for is SEO for brand expansion and ads. SEO is defined as \"the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine\". You can learn more about it here: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide \n",
    "\n",
    "Some platforms, such as Pinterest, heavily rely on SEO to rank content. Pinterest is a social media platform that allows for photo and short-form video content. Many businesses use Pinterest to post photos of products they carry as Pinterest allows for direct links back to their website as well as paid ads. For example, this was my first search result for the keyword \"jeans\". You'll notice that the photo links back to the brand's website. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/571394271485001829/ \n",
    "\n",
    "If a business wanted to promote their products on Pinterest, it would be wise to use keywords in their product description that reflect keywords that are frequently searched on Google. If we use \"jeans\" as our example, this would include all search terms we've seen earlier related to jeans, as long as they are relevant to the post. If we wanted to utilize trending searches (that may lead to more sales in the short term, but no the long term), we could utilize the \"breakout/rising\" searches. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now take a look at the top Google search terms for \"jeans\" over the past 12 months. You can find this info here: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2021-05-14%202022-05-14&geo=US&q=jeans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice under the \"Related queries\" section, there are no searches for skinny jeans; however, there are multiple searches related to flared jeans, wide leg jeans, and bootcut jeans, which are similar in style (all flare at the calf). This is an indicator that this style of jean in particular is highly marketable. Competitor brands are also available under the same link which could be useful as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a business owner chooses to include trendier styles as well, we could take a look at the \"Fashion\" section of rising trends on Pinterest, available here: https://trends.pinterest.com/?fashion=0. An overlap of tending pinterst fashion topics and Google searches is also an indicator of a highly marketable product."

Within this subsection, flared-style jeans have been more popular in the past 12 months. We have also identified that items that are female-specific are searched much more frequently, and also generate approximately 2.35 times the revenue as men's products. If you are starting a fashion-related small business, this data suggests the demographic targeted should be girls and women, and products sold should include jeans, boots, and black items as they maintain relevance the longest. \n",

    "If I wished to conduct further analysis at this point, there are several routes I could take. I could choose to repeat this process with a different search term and find similarities and differences among the two. I could also do further analysis on search terms I found to be highly marketable. For example, I know boots have maintained popularity for many years. I could do further research to identify what style of boots are most marketable (ex: riding boots, ankle boots, snow boots, etc...). Similarly, I could do a more in-depth analysis to identify what items in \"black outfits\" are the most popular (ex: jeans, shirt, boots, etc...).  \n",
